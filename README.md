# <b>Welcome to <em>UniConnect</em>!</b>
<em><b>‘UniConnect’</b></em> aims to join students from various universities across downtown Toronto through common interests and events. Students who want to participate in group activities but do not know where to look can now go onto our web app to do so. Users can select their interests through our unique tagging system, ranging from arts and music to technology and gaming which will allow them to find related events. By joining events, users can meet up with people virtually and in person to connect through common interests. </br></br>

# Features

Below, we have listed out our main features provided for users on our web app. Differences between administrators and users will be explained as well as our plans going forwards.

### <b>Navigation</b>

When first arriving on our page, end-users will be greeted by our lively landing page.

From there, users can search for events using the search bar, login or signup. When logging in, users can always reset their password or make a new account. Admins, on the other hand, are created only on an appointed basis, and thus cannot simply sign up. Further functionality for admins will be added with a database.
