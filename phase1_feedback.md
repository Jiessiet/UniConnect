Good job! Here is some feedback to help you improve:

On the main landing page, I would suggest making the elements above the wavy animation to occupy less space, otherwise it is very easy to miss the nice infograph that you designed at the bottom of the page. The instruction "Find buddies" is a bit ambiguous and I didn't know what to write or what to expect to see upon searching something. Why don't you put the image and the search bar side by side, instead one above each other? This way, you can use the space much more efficiently, since the user is unlikely to type such a large string of text anyway. Finally, the key "Enter" is refreshing the page instead of confirming the search. Make sure you have a button named "Search" too, for usability purposes.

There should be an option to see all events without having to type something, though. Maybe display a couple of them on the front page, like a "highlighted events" section, as well as a "See More" button? Also, if you click on the image next to the search bar, I think it would be nice if it led you to the "Timeline" route.

The page where you show the events (the route "Timeline") is pretty good! But maybe you should allow for the entire div representing the event to be clickable, instead of just the "Learn More" text (but do keep that text).

The page for specific events (the route "GameEventDetails"), despite being on the right track, still has many elements that require styling. For instance, the title is too large, and the text indented to the right makes it hard to see some important information about the event. You should aim at having the text indented to the left, like most of it already is. The box containing the description is nice, but I recommend adding some very transparent colored background to it so that the user doesn't mistake it with an input box. Also, while the title and the image seem pretty large, the rest of the text seems pretty small.

The icons on the top bar need some text to accompany them, as their meaning is a bit cryptic. Just have the text next to them, and add some margin so that one text is clearly attached to one icon and not the other.

I couldn't edit my profile, it just didn't work. Also, I'm not sure if you should go to a completely different interface when editing the profile. At least try to keep the background consistent! (I recommend using the light green background for the profile too, instead of a plain white background).

Your complexity level is perfect, especially in the form of how much stuff you can do on your website, such as adding courses, friends, editing interests, tags, etc. It's really good!
